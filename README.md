I have done Titanic survival prediction project with 77% accuracy on KAGGLE platform.
Logistic Regression -- A Titanic Survival Prediction Case Study
Titanic Dataset â€“
* It is one of the most popular datasets used for understanding machine learning basics.
* It contains information of all the passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, which unfortunately was shipwrecked.
* This dataset can be used to predict whether a given passenger survived or not.
* The csv file can be downloaded from Kaggle.
  #Process of Machine Learning invlove the following step
## STEP 1> DATA COLLECTION
## STEP 2> CLEANING OF RAW DATA
## STEP 3> EDA/FE (exploratory data analysis)/(feature extraction)
## STEP 4> DATA SPLIT TRAIN/TEST
## STEP 5> MODEL SELECTION AND MODEL TRAINING ON TRAINING DATASET
## STEP 6> MODEL TEST ON TESING DATASET
## STEP 7> MODEL EVALUTION
## STEP 8> FINAL MODEL AND RESULT
